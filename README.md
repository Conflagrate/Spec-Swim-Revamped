# Spec-Swim-Revamped

A "Fantasy Football" interpretation of swimming written entirely by John Limberis under the alias "Conflagrate". This project was first started on March 28th, 2020 and doubles as the official submission for the 2020 AP Computer Science Principles Create Task as well as the background computations and calculations for the app made for the Lakeland Hills YMCA 2019-2020 Senior 4 and Senior 3 groups. Currently, it is being revamped and redeveloped in order to improve the app.

## Usage and Permissions
The `main.py` file and its contents pull from multiple sources, including the self-created libraries developed within this program. Meet Mobile's API, Swimcloud's API, and USA Swimming's PPC are all used to source external data. Personal usage is considered unofficial and therefore not recorded in the live app. Only automated usage and identified contributors have access to the official output. For more information about being an input contributor, please contact us at our [official email](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?tab=rm&ogbl#inbox?compose=GTvVlcRzCMpvXBQzsZpHdzVPQtcpvKLsWzcXQXmBwPkQPBJqJSmNCNPpMmcZPrKczZVMnjmzphTMP).

Besides input contributors, we would also love some code contributions! If you see an opportunity to refactor the code to make it more efficient or have another feature in mind that you can implement, you should [create a pull request](https://github.com/Conflagrate/Spec-Swim-Revamped/pulls). To merge your branch into the master, shoot us an email and we'll check out your new code.

## Rules and Regulations
The official rule book has not yet been published, but here is a simple breakdown:

### The Draft
Top draft prospects have a higher overall rating, making them more likely to come off the board sooner. 

`5 points` for a head-to-head swimmer win (ex. one of your starting swimmers has an overall faster meet than one of your opponent's starting swimmers).
`50 points` for a full-on starting A/B team sweep.
